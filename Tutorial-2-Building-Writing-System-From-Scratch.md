## Part 1: Building Writing Practice System from Scratch

### Chapter Goal
Through natural dialogue with Claude Code, design and establish a complete writing practice system from zero.

### Background Description
This is the core part of the entire tutorial. We will demonstrate how to express vague ideas in natural language and let Claude Code help us clarify requirements, design structure, and establish processes. This process perfectly demonstrates the essence of agent collaborative development.

### Actual Operation Demonstration

**‚è±Ô∏è Stage 1: Requirements Clarification (5 minutes)**

**[00:00] Natural Conversation Initiation**

Open Claude Code and input:
```text
I want to establish a writing practice system to improve my writing ability, but I don't know where to start. Can you help me design it? I hope it's suitable for people with easily distracted attention.
```

**Claude's Guidance (Expected Response)**:
```text
I'd be happy to help you design a writing practice system! Let me first understand some specific situations:

1. What are your writing practice goals? (e.g., improving description skills, logical thinking, creative expression, etc.)
2. How much time can you roughly invest in practice each day?
3. You mentioned "easily distracted attention" - what specific situations does this refer to?
4. Have you tried other writing practice methods before?

Based on this information, I can design a personalized practice system for you.
```

**[02:00] Respond to Claude's Questions**

Based on Claude's guidance, answer:
```text
1. I hope to improve observation skills, logical thinking, and expression abilities, ultimately able to write articles with depth
2. I can roughly invest 10-15 minutes per day, not too long
3. My attention is easily distracted, it's hard to persist in long-term activities
4. I tried journaling before, but always gave up after writing for a few days

I hope this system can help me establish sustainable writing habits.
```

**Claude's Design Suggestions (Expected Response)**:
```text
Based on your situation, I suggest designing an attention-friendly writing practice system:

Core Principles:
- Micro-session design: 5-15 minutes each time, fits attention characteristics
- Low-friction startup: Reduce decision fatigue with clear guidance
- Structured templates: Reduce "don't know what to write" confusion
- Instant positive feedback: Can see progress, maintain motivation

Practice Type Suggestions:
1. Observation Practice: Improve detail perception ability
2. Thinking Practice: Exercise logic and viewpoint expression
3. Structure Practice: Train information organization ability
4. Free Creation: Comprehensive use of various skills

Would you like me to help you design specific file structure and practice processes?
```

**‚è±Ô∏è Stage 2: Structure Design (3 minutes)**

**[05:00] Discuss File Structure**

Continue dialogue:
```text
This design approach is great! Please help me design specific file structure. I hope to be able to:
1. Conveniently record daily thoughts and inspirations
2. Systematically conduct different types of practice
3. Organize and review previous content
4. Finally output complete articles
```

**Claude's Structure Suggestions (Expected Response)**:
```text
Based on your needs, I suggest this directory structure:

```
writing-practice-project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 01-materials/          # Daily ideas and inspiration collection
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ thought-fragments/   # Random thoughts recorded anytime
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ daily-observations/  # Life observation records
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ inspiration-collection/ # Creative ideas and inspirations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 02-practice-records/     # Organized practice
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2024-12/            # Monthly organization
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/          # Practice templates
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 03-output-results/       # Complete articles
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ practice-workflow-guide.md # Usage guide
```

This structure has several advantages:
1. Material library lets you record ideas anytime, lowering startup threshold
2. Practice records are organized but without pressure
3. Output results give you clear production goals
4. Monthly folders facilitate review and progress statistics

How do you think about this structure? Need any adjustments?
```

**[07:00] Confirm and Optimize Structure**

Reply:
```text
The structure is excellent! I especially like the material library design, so I can record ideas anytime. Can you help me create these directories? Also, what exactly are the practice templates you mentioned?
```

**‚è±Ô∏è Stage 3: Create Directory Structure (2 minutes)**

**[08:00] Claude Creates Directories**

Claude will use tools to create directory structure:
```text
I'll help you create this directory structure.
```

Then Claude will use corresponding commands to create folders and basic files.

**‚è±Ô∏è Stage 4: Design Practice Process (5 minutes)**

**[10:00] Discuss Practice Arrangement**

Continue dialogue:
```text
The directory structure is perfect! Can you now help me design specific practice processes? I hope to have clear practice guidance every day, but without feeling pressure.
```

**Claude's Process Design (Expected Response)**:
```text
I'll design a cyclic practice process for you that's both regular and varied:

Weekly Practice Arrangement:
- Mon/Wed/Fri: Observation Practice (improve perception)
- Tue/Thu: Thinking Practice (exercise logic)
- Saturday: Structure Practice (organize summary)
- Sunday: Free Creation (comprehensive application)

Characteristics of each practice:
1. Observation Practice (5-10 minutes)
   - Choose any object around you for deep observation
   - Record visual, tactile, emotional responses
   - Train detail perception ability

2. Thinking Practice (10-15 minutes)
   - Choose a topic for deep thinking
   - Form viewpoints and find supporting evidence
   - Train logical thinking ability

3. Structure Practice (10-15 minutes)
   - Review this week's materials and practice
   - Try to reorganize and framework
   - Train information organization ability

4. Free Creation (15 minutes)
   - Free writing based on this week's materials
   - Comprehensive use of various skills
   - Produce complete short essays

Benefits of this arrangement:
- Clear daily tasks, no need to struggle with what to do
- Short time, fits attention characteristics
- Progressive from observation to creation
- Regular but not monotonous

Would you like me to design specific templates for each practice?
```

**‚è±Ô∏è Stage 5: Create Practice Templates (3 minutes)**

**[15:00] Request Template Creation**

Reply:
```text
This arrangement is excellent! Please help me create templates for each practice. I hope templates can guide my thinking but won't limit creativity.
```

**Claude Creates Templates**

Claude will create specific template files, for example:

**Observation Practice Template**:
```markdown
# Observation Practice - {Date}

**Theme:** {Specific observation object}
**Goal:** Improve detail perception and description skills

## üîç Observation Object
Choose any object in front of you, observe carefully for 30 seconds

**Object:** 

## üìù Detailed Description (3-5 minutes)
**Visual Details:**

**Texture/Touch:**

**Emotional Response:**

## üí≠ Deep Thinking (2 minutes)
