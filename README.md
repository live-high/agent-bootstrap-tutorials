- **Rapid Validation**: Small steps, quick iterations, timely direction adjustments

### The Power of Agent Self-Bootstrapping
The ultimate goal is creating a self-reinforcing workflow:
- **Tools Creating Tools**: Agent-built tools are reused by Agent
- **Knowledge Self-Loop**: Each use accumulates more knowledge for the system
- **Workflow Automation**: Thinking, planning, documentation all automatically saved and archived
- **Continuous Optimization**: Continuously optimize tools and processes based on usage data
