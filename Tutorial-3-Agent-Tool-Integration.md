## 3.1 Tool Documentation

### Chapter Goal
Enable Claude Code to understand and correctly use your built writing tools.

### Background Description
Although Claude Code participated in the tool construction process, to ensure future Claude instances can also skillfully use this tool, we need to improve project documentation.

### Specific Operations

#### Step 1: Update CLAUDE.md

Tell Claude Code:
```text
Now we have completed the CLI tool construction. Please help me update the CLAUDE.md file, adding tool usage instructions so future Claude instances can skillfully use this tool.
```

#### Expected Update Content

Claude will add to CLAUDE.md:

```markdown
## CLI Tool Usage

### Tool Overview
The project contains a command-line tool named `writing_cli.py`, invoked through the `./w` quick script.

### Core Commands
- `./w init` - Initialize practice environment, set user configuration
- `./w practice` - Start today's practice, automatically select practice type based on day of week
- `./w status` - View practice status, consecutive days, skill statistics
- `./w note "content"` - Quick record ideas to inspiration collection file
- `./w random` - Get random practice prompts

### Automation Features
- **Smart Practice Scheduling**: Automatically select practice type based on day of week
- **Template-based File Generation**: Automatically create structured practice files
- **Progress Tracking**: Consecutive days statistics and skill category recording
- **Low-friction Recording**: Record ideas with one command

### File Organization
- Practice files automatically saved to `02-practice-records/YYYY-MM/`
- Quick records appended to `01-materials/inspiration-collection/quick-notes.md`
- Configuration stored in `.writing_config.json`
- Progress data stored in `.writing_progress.json`

### Usage Suggestions
When users mention writing practice, recording ideas, or checking progress in conversation, actively suggest using corresponding commands.
```

#### Step 2: Create Usage Examples

Continue requesting:
```text
Please create some usage examples for this tool, showing which command should be used in what situations.
```

**Expected Example Documentation**:
```markdown
## Usage Examples

### Daily Usage Scenarios

**Situation 1: User wants to start today's practice**
Suggestion: `./w status` to check today's recommendation, then `./w practice` to start practice

**Situation 2: User suddenly has an idea**
Suggestion: `./w note "specific idea content"` for quick recording

**Situation 3: User wants to understand their practice situation**
Suggestion: `./w status` to view statistical data

**Situation 4: User doesn't know what to practice**
Suggestion: `./w random` to get random prompts

**Situation 5: New user first time using**
Suggestion: First `./w init` to initialize, then `./w practice` to experience

### Combined Usage with Conversation

When discussing writing practice related topics, we can:
1. First record ideas with tool: `./w note "insights from conversation"`
2. Check current status: `./w status`
3. Start related practice: `./w practice`

This forms a complete loop of "dialogue ‚Üí recording ‚Üí practice".
```

#### Checkpoint Items
- [ ] CLAUDE.md contains complete tool usage instructions
- [ ] Usage examples are clear and specific
- [ ] Includes combined usage with conversation
- [ ] Future Claude instances can understand and use tools

## 3.2 Tool Integration Testing

### Chapter Goal
Verify that Claude Code can correctly understand and invoke tool functions.

### Testing Process

#### Test 1: Let Claude Use Tool to Record Ideas

Tell Claude:
```text
I just thought of an interesting viewpoint: "The greatest value of agent collaborative development is not improving coding speed, but lowering the psychological threshold for project startup." Please help me record this in the material library.
```

**Expected Operation**:
Claude should use:
```bash
./w note "The greatest value of agent collaborative development is not improving coding speed, but lowering the psychological threshold for project startup"
```

**Expected Output**:
```text
üí° Inspiration recorded to: /Users/.../01-materials/inspiration-collection/quick-notes.md
```

#### Test 2: Check Project Status

Continue conversation:
```text
How is the progress of our writing practice project now?
```

**Expected Operation**:
Claude should use:
```bash
./w status
```

Then report current practice status based on output results.

#### Test 3: Assist Starting Practice

Say:
```text
I want to do today's writing practice.
```

**Expected Operation Flow**:
1. Claude first uses `./w status` to check today's recommendation
2. Tell you today's practice type and theme
3. Use `./w practice` to start practice
4. Guide you to complete practice according to template

#### Test 4: Handle Random Practice Request

Say:
```text
I don't have specific ideas now, can you give me a writing practice prompt?
```

**Expected Operation**:
Claude should use:
```bash
./w random
```

Then guide you to start practice based on returned random prompt.

### Integration Verification Standards

Excellent integration should meet:
- [ ] Claude can actively identify when to use tools
- [ ] Command invocation is correct with appropriate parameters
- [ ] Can interpret tool output and provide useful feedback
- [ ] Integrates naturally with conversation flow, not abrupt
- [ ] Can provide effective troubleshooting suggestions when errors occur

## 3.3 Workflow Establishment

### Chapter Goal
Establish stable agent+tool collaboration mode, forming sustainable usage habits.

### Design Collaboration Workflow

#### Daily Writing Practice Process

**Step 1: Morning Startup**
```
User ‚Üí "Start today's writing practice"
Claude ‚Üí ./w status (check recommendations)
Claude ‚Üí Inform today's practice type and suggested duration
Claude ‚Üí ./w practice (start practice)
User ‚Üí Complete practice according to template
Claude ‚Üí Confirm completion, give encouraging feedback
```

**Step 2: Inspiration Recording**
```
User ‚Üí Share sudden ideas or observations
Claude ‚Üí ./w note "specific content" (immediate recording)
Claude ‚Üí Possible extended discussion or associated thinking
```

**Step 3: Progress Review**
```
User ‚Üí Ask about practice situation or progress
Claude ‚Üí ./w status (check statistics)
Claude ‚Üí Analyze progress, give suggestions and encouragement
```

#### Advanced Collaboration Modes

**Mode 1: Topic Deep Exploration**
```
1. User proposes a topic
2. Claude deeply discusses with user
3. Claude uses ./w note to record key insights
4. Suggest user do related thinking practice
5. Use ./w practice to guide practice
6. Form "discussion‚Üírecording‚Üípractice" loop
```

**Mode 2: Creative Project Support**
```
1. User wants to write an article
2. Claude uses ./w status to check available materials
3. Suggest related preparation exercises
4. Assist in organizing and structuring ideas
5. Support creative process, timely record inspiration
```

**Mode 3: Review and Optimization**
```
1. Regularly review practice records
2. Analyze practice patterns and effects
3. Discuss optimization directions
4. Adjust practice focus and frequency
```

### Establish Usage Habits

#### Daily Fixed Times
- **Morning**: `./w status` + `./w practice`
- **Anytime**: Immediate `./w note` when ideas emerge
- **Evening**: Review daily records and practice

#### Weekly Review
- Check this week's practice records
- Count completion of different practice types
- Identify progress and areas needing strengthening

#### Key Points for Collaboration with Claude
1. **Proactivity**: Let Claude actively suggest tool usage
2. **Coherence**: Tool usage naturally integrates with conversation
3. **Feedback**: Meaningful discussion based on tool output
4. **Growth**: Collaboration methods continuously optimize with deeper usage

### Experience Tool Self-Bootstrapping

Now the most interesting moment arrives: **Use your built tool to record the process of building this tool**!

Tell Claude:
```text
We just completed the tool integration tutorial, this process is very interesting. Please help me record this experience using the tool.
```

Claude should use:
```bash
./w note "Completed complete integration of CLI tool, achieving agent-tool collaboration loop. Particularly interesting is now using the built tool to record the building process, forming perfect self-bootstrapping cycle."
```

This is the wonderful experience of **Tool Self-Bootstrapping** - using tools to record the process of creating tools!
